# PathTracing_CG
Path Tracing Renderer: Cornell Box
Path Tracing is a rendering algorithm based on the Monte Carlo method, which tracks the propagation path of light in the scene, calculates pixel color values, and generates high-quality and realistic images. In this report, we will summarize the implementation process of path tracking algorithms and some optimization strategies to improve rendering efficiency and image quality.
